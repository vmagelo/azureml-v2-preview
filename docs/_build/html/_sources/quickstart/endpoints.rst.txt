Deploy Models (WIP)
===================

.. warning::
    This documentation is not fully functional. Endpoint creation is officially launching in January.

Models can be deployed as online or batch mode Endpoints.

An Endpoint is an instantiation of your model into either a web service that can be hosted in the cloud or an IoT module for integrated device deployments.
Below are two examples creating an endpoint.



.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/deploy/sklearn/basicaksendpoint.yml
   :language: yaml

To create the endpoint, run the following:

.. code-block:: console

  az ml endpoint create --file basicaksendpoint.yml

Minimal endpoint specification - batch
