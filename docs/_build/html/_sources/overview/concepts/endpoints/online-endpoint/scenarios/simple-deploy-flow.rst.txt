Simple deploy flow
==================

.. note::
    1. Clone or fork this `repo <https://github.com/Azure/azureml-v2-preview>`_ to try the below scenarios from your CLI.
    2. Private preview for this functionality is invite only at this point (your subscription needs to be onboarded).
    

Step 1: Deploy simple endpoint
------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash 
    
    az ml endpoint create --name my-endpoint -f examples/endpoints/online/managed/simple-flow/1-create-endpoint-with-blue.yaml

**Note**: Replace the above endpoint name with a unique name (it should be unique at region level). Use the same name in all of the below commands.

This is the yaml file

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/simple-flow/1-create-endpoint-with-blue.yaml
   :language: yaml

Get the state of endpoint/deployment along with the status
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
.. code-block:: bash
    
    az ml endpoint show -n my-endpoint

you can use the `--query parameter <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/query-azure-cli>`_ to get only specific attributes from the returned data

Step 2: Now test the endpoint
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: bash
    
    az ml endpoint invoke -n my-endpoint --request-file examples/endpoints/online/model-1/sample-request.json


For instructions on using your own client (like postman) see the Appendix below

Step 3: Check the container logs
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash
    
    az ml endpoint log -n my-endpoint --deployment blue --tail 100

by default the logs are pulled from the `inference-server`. However you can pull it from `storage-initializer` container by passing --container `storage-initializer`

Step 4: Check out metrics from Azure Poral
-------------------------------------------------

Open the resource group from azure portal -> open the endpoint and deployment ARM resources
-> you can see summary view in the overview page and details in the metrics tab


Step 5: Check out log analytics
-------------------------------------------------

1. Create a log analytics workspace. Note: During preview period, both loganalytics workspace and azure ml workspace has to be in either westeurope or westus2.
1. Open the ARM resource page from endpoint -> select `Diagnostic settings` -> Add settings (add a log analytics workspace - create one if needed)
2. Make some scoring requests for logs to flow to Log Analytics
3. Open the log analytics workspace -> Click on `Logs` on left nav -> Close the `Queries` popup opend by default -> double click on `AmlOnlineEndpointConsoleLog` -> click `Run`

Step 6: [Optionally] Delete the endpoint along with the deployment
------------------------------------------------------------------

Do **not** run this step if you plan to run the :ref:`declarative-flow`

.. code-block:: bash

    az ml endpoint delete -n my-endpoint

Invoking the scoring endpoint using REST clients
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

**Step 1: Get the scoring URI**

replace 'my-endpoints' with name of your endpoint in the below command

.. code-block:: bash
    
    az ml endpoint show -n my-endpoint --query "scoring_uri"

**Step 2: Get the azure ml auth token**

Copy the value of the accessToken from this

.. code-block:: bash
    
    az ml endpoint list-keys -n my-endpoint

**Step 3: Use the URI and the token in your REST client**

If you use postman, then go to the Authorization tab in the request and paste the value of the token. Use the scoring uri form above as the URI for the POST request.
